  - Consignee Name (from order data)
  - Total Amount (from order data)
  - Deleted By (user who deleted it)
  - Deleted At (timestamp)
  - Status (Deleted/Restored)
  - Action Button (Restore/View Restored)

## Usage

### Viewing Delete History
1. Navigate to the History page
2. Click on the "Delete BL History" tab
3. Use the filter dropdowns to filter by specific users or status if needed
4. View the complete audit trail of deleted orders

### Restoring Deleted Orders
1. In the Delete BL History tab, find the order you want to restore
2. Click the "üîÑ Restore" button for orders that haven't been restored yet
3. Confirm the restoration in the dialog
4. The system will create a new order with all the original data and parcels
5. The status will change to "‚úì Restored" with timestamp and user information
6. A "üëÅÔ∏è View Restored" button will appear to view the restored order

## Security & Data Integrity
- Only users with appropriate permissions can access the history page and restore orders
- All deletions are automatically logged (cannot be bypassed)
- Deletion logs cannot be deleted (audit integrity)
- Complete order data is preserved for accurate restoration
- Restoration creates new orders (doesn't reuse old IDs for integrity)
- Restoration tracking prevents double-restoration

## Technical Notes
- Restored orders get new database IDs but maintain all original data
- Associated parcels are also restored with proper linking
- Original timestamps are preserved in the stored data
- Restoration timestamps track when the restore action occurred
