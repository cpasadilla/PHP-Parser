/**
 * Test script to verify AR/OR display fix
 * 
 * This script demonstrates how the new AR/OR tracking system works:
 * 
 * PROBLEM BEFORE FIX:
 * - When User 1 updated OR for BL 002, all AR/OR fields showed User 1's info
 * - When User 2 updated AR for BL 009, all AR/OR fields changed to User 2's info
 * - The shared fields (or_ar_date, updated_by, updated_location) were being overwritten
 * 
 * SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
 * 1. Removed shared field updates in updateOrderField method
 * 2. Enhanced getArOrDisplayInfo method to return separate AR and OR display information
 * 3. Modified JavaScript to store and display field-specific information
 * 4. Added focus/blur handlers to show specific information when editing AR/OR fields
 * 
 * HOW TO TEST:
 * 1. Have User 1 (from Batanes) update OR number for BL 002
 * 2. Have User 2 (from Manila) update AR number for BL 009  
 * 3. Refresh the page
 * 4. Verify that:
 *    - BL 002 shows User 1's info in DATE PAID, NOTED BY, PAID IN
 *    - BL 009 shows User 2's info in DATE PAID, NOTED BY, PAID IN
 *    - Each field retains its specific update information
 * 5. Click/focus on OR field of BL 002 - should highlight OR-specific info
 * 6. Click/focus on AR field of BL 009 - should highlight AR-specific info
 * 
 * TECHNICAL CHANGES MADE:
 * 
 * 1. MasterListController.php:
 *    - Enhanced getArOrDisplayInfo() to return separate AR/OR display info
 *    - Removed shared field updates in updateOrderField() for AR/OR fields
 *    - Modified response to include field-specific information
 * 
 * 2. list.blade.php:
 *    - Updated JavaScript to handle separate AR/OR display information
 *    - Added focus/blur handlers for enhanced user experience
 *    - Stores field-specific info in row data attributes
 * 
 * 3. Database tracking:
 *    - Still uses OrderUpdateLog table for tracking individual field changes
 *    - Location info embedded in new_value field with |LOCATION: separator
 *    - Each AR/OR update creates separate log entry
